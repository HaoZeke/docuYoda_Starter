# Spooky Action at a Distance

Some text here. I wonder if this is OK.

It is of course much slower than the lightning fast tup.


## Advantages

* Easily configured.
* Look I cite @lion2010.
* That means I am awesome.

New check. This ought to update.

Now this works via [prose.io](http://prose.io) which is good for images.

[Stackedit](https://stackedit.io) has math rendering so that's a huge plus.
However it also adds weird cruft to the files. So.. NOT RECOMMENDED.

Plus I know math.

Honest!

$$\int_0^\infty\sin{x} = ?$$

$\prec$ stands for accessibility. Basically the order relation.

[Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) has great rendering for math, but no images and it doesn't understand single dollar symbols for math.

Well so what.

That's sort of math as well.
Look it up.

I do TeX too

**Bye.**

Hahaha
