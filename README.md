**Check the output [here](https://github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda_Starter/blob/pdf/spooky-action.pdf).**

This is the template for docuYoda rapid protoyping for academic documents.
The template comes with **batteries included** as it includes the dependencies for complete offline use. 

Both pandoc style citations and traditional TeX citations are enabled, however keep in mind that TeX citations will not display in non-TeX files.

Read about the project at it's source [here](https://www.github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda) or on the documentation site [here](https://docuyoda.surge.sh).

For creating presentations, refer to the sibling project, [zenYoda](http://zenyoda.surge.sh/) and it's [starter template](http://zenyodasap.surge.sh/).

## Setup
The dependencies are very light, just a full TeX distribution and yarn (with nodejs of course).

## Folder Structure
The configuration for each file is done by `yaml` files in `src/config`.
The gulp tasks exposed will handle appending these configurations in the form of frontmatter.

**DO NOT** add any frontmatter in the `.md` files.
Instead add global frontmatter to the `src/config/commonConf.yml` file.

**DO NOT** add frontmatter delimiters to **ANY** of the configuration `yml` files either, the gulp tasks will handle those.

The pdfs are eventually generated by latexmk so the configuration file is present in `src/tex`. Typically this does not need to be edited, however, depending on the requirements feel free to change the options there.

Put all images in `src/img` and refer to them with an `img/` prefix.

ie., if you have `cat.jpg` in `src/img` you would use regular markdown like so:

```markdown
![I am the caption](img/cat.jpg "I'm the alt text.")
```

## Gulp Tasks

```bash
# Runs the default
gulp
# Runs with production settings (clean latexmk crap)
gulp --env production
```

## Usage

### PaaS

Simply fork the repo.


Edit the content in `src/md/*.md`, along with references in `src/refs.bib` and also the appropriate configuration files in `src/config/` using any of the following:

- Github Native Editor
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) *[NOT RECOMMENED] {Adds weird cruft}*
- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io)
- [Prose.io](http://prose.io) *[recommended]*

You may use any of the pandoc markdown syntax, even if the viewers above do not support the entire syntax

[Prose.io](http://prose.io) is recommended because it's free and image support is basically drag and drop/ *[remember to ensure the path is `src/img/`]*

You'll need to edit the [Semaphore CI Settings](https://semaphoreci.com) for the repo as shown below:

![](readme/semaSettings.png "Settings")

- The first build WILL TAKE around ~20 minutes.
- Subsequent builds will only take around ~6 minutes or less.
- It's best to setup the CI immediately on forking the repository, then start working.


### Local

Simply clone the repo and start changing stuff!

You can enable file watching by:

```bash
# Install stuff
yarn
# Watch and reload
yarn gulp watch
# Clean and produce final pdf
yarn gulp
```
