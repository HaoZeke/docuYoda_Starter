This is the template for docuYoda rapid protoyping for academic documents.
The template comes with **batteries included** as it includes the dependencies for complete offline use. 

Both pandoc style citations and traditional TeX citations are enabled, however keep in mind that TeX citations will not display in non-TeX files.

Read about the project at it's source [here](https://www.github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda) or on the documentation site [here](https://docuyoda.surge.sh).

For creating presentations, refer to the sibling project, [zenYoda](http://zenyoda.surge.sh/) and it's [starter template](http://zenyodasap.surge.sh/).

## Folder Structure
The configuration for each file is done by `yaml` files in `src/config`.
The gulp tasks exposed will handle appending these configurations in the form of frontmatter.

**DO NOT** add any frontmatter in the `.md` files.
Instead add global frontmatter to the `src/config/commonConf.yml` file.

**DO NOT** add frontmatter delimiters to **ANY** of the configuration `yml` files either, the gulp tasks will handle those.

The pdfs are eventually generated by latexmk so the configuration file is present in `src/tex`. Typically this does not need to be edited, however, depending on the requirements feel free to change the options there.

## Gulp Tasks


## Usage

### PaaS
Simply fork the repo.


Edit the content slides in `src/md/*.md`, along with references in `src/refs.bib` and also the appropriate configuration files in `src/config/` using any of the following:

- Github Native Editor
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io)
- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io)
- [Prose.io](http://prose.io)

You may use any of the pandoc markdown syntax, even if the viewers above do not support the entire syntax


You'll need to edit the [Travis CI Settings](https://travis-ci.org/) for the repo as shown below:

![](readme/travisVar.png "Variables to be set")

- The first build WILL TAKE around ~20 minutes.
- Subsequent builds will only take around ~10 minutes or less.
- It's best to setup the CI immediately on forking the repository, then start working.

### Local

Simply clone the repo and start changing slideConf.yml and slides.md

You can enable file watching by:

```bash
# Runs the monitor and automatically rebuilds on changes
tup monitor -a
# Stop the monitor
tup stop
```

For automatic reloading, get [browsersync](https://browsersync.io) and run the following in another terminal:

```bash
# Get browsersync
yarn global add browser-sync
# Get live reloading
browser-sync start -s 'sap' -f 'sap'
```

The output is basically a SAP whoich may be deployed to Travis for posterity. (check the [project docs](https://zenyoda.surge.sh))

Point your browser to [the application](localhost:3000).

For using Travis, change the site name in Travis. (more in the docs)
